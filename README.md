# Regression with CART Trees

## Introduction
Decision tree is a supervised machine learning model that can be used both for classification and regression tasks. We have seen that a decision tree uses a tree structure to predict an output class for a given input example in a classification task. For regression analysis, In the tree, each path from the root node to a leaf node represents a decision path that ends in a predicted value. In this lesson , we shall see how regression is performed in using a decision tree regressor using a simple example.  

Note: Kindly visit the [Official doc.](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) for the regressor tree function used in this lesson. 


## Objectives
You will be able to:
- Understand and explain recursive partitioning 
- Understand the maths behind recursive partitioning of sample space by CART trees
- Run a simple regression experiment with regression trees and evaluate/visualize the results

## Recursive Partitioning 

Linear regression is considered a __global model__ as there is a single model holding over the entire sample space. For data containing complex features holding complicated and nonlinear relations, assembling such a single global model can be very difficult and computationally expensive task. 

An alternative approach to nonlinear regression is to __partition the sample space into smaller regions__, as we have already seen with classification trees. For regression, we partition the sub-divisions again until we get the regions in space that can be targeted using simple models. This is known as  called recursive partitioning. 

> The global model has two parts: one is just the __recursive partition__, the other is a simple model for each unit of the partition.

In regression trees , each of the terminal nodes, or leaves, of the tree represents a __cell of the partition__, and associates a simple model to this cell. A point x belongs to a leaf if x falls in the corresponding cell of the partition. We start at the root node of the tree as before  and ask a sequence of questions about the features. Internal nodes are labeled with questions, and the edges between them are labeled by the answers. Each question refers to only a single attribute, and has a yes or no answer, e.g.,
“Is distance > 50?” or “Is Sex == Female?”. That’s the recursive partition part. 


## Simple Local Models
For classic regression trees, the model in each cell is just a constant estimate of Y . 

For points (xi, yi),(x2, y2), . . .(xc, yc) are all the samples belonging to a leaf-node . Then our model for this leaf node l is just the sample mean of the dependent variable in that cell. This is a piecewise-constant
model. There are several advantages to this including faster predictions with simpler calculations, easy to understand and interpret models. 

Consider the Regression tree below which predicts the price of cars showing an interaction between wheelbase and horsepower:

Next, we shall look at the partition of the sample space implied by the regression tree from the figure above. Notice that all the dividing lines are parallel to the axes, because each internal node checks whether a single variable is above or below a given value.
<img src="dt2.png" width=400>

The tree correctly represents the interaction between Horsepower and Wheelbase, i.e. when Horsepower > 0.6, Wheelbase no longer matters. When both are equally important, the tree switches between them. 

Once we train the tree, the local models are completely understood,  so all the effort should go into finding a good partitioning of the data. 

### CART training algorithm 
In this lab we will focus on the *CART* algorithm (Classification and Regression Trees) for *regression*. 

>The CART algorithm builds a *binary tree* in which every non-leaf node has exactly two children (corresponding to a yes/no answer). 

Given a set of training examples and their labels, the algorithm repeatedly splits the training examples $D$ into two subsets $D_{left}, D_{right}$ using some feature set $f$ and feature threshold $t_f$ such that samples with the same label are grouped together. 

At each node, the algorithm selects the split $\theta = (f, t_f)$ that produces the smallest *mean squared error* (MSE) (alternatively, we could use the mean absolute error).

So at each step, the algorithm selects the parameters $\theta$ that minimize the following cost function:

\begin{equation}
J(D, \theta) = \frac{n_{left}}{n_{total}} MSE_{left} + \frac{n_{right}}{n_{total}} MSE_{right}
\end{equation}

- $D$: remaining training examples   
- $n_{total}$ : number of remaining training examples
- $\theta = (f, t_f)$: feature and feature threshold
- $n_{left}/n_{right}$: number of samples in the left/right subset
- $MSE_{left}/MSE_{right}$: MSE of the left/right subset

This step is repeated recursively until the *maximum allowable depth* is reached or the current number of samples $n_{total}$ drops below some minimum number. The original equations can be found [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html).

After building the tree, new examples can be classified by navigating through the tree, testing at each node the corresponding feature until a leaf node/prediction is reached.

### Mean Squared Error (MSE)

When performing regression with CART trees (i.e. the target values are continuous) we can evaluate a split using its MSE. The MSE of node $m$ is computed as follows:

\begin{equation}
\hat{y}_m = \frac{1}{n_{m}} \sum_{i \in D_m} y_i
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
MSE_m = \frac{1}{n_{m}} \sum_{i \in D_m} (y_i - \hat{y}_m)^2
\end{equation}

- $D_m$: training examples in node $m$
- $n_{m}$ : total number of training examples in node $m$
- $y_i$: target value of $i-$th example

Let's see above in action with a simple experiment. We shall generate some non-linear synthetic data for our X and y attributes and fit it to a regression tree. So let's move ahead with this. In order to have a visual understanding of how this works, we shall only a simple regression problem between two variables X and y , where y is a simple function of X that we want to learn. Let's see this below:

## Genarate Data

```python
# Import libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
plt.style.use('seaborn')
np.random.seed(124)

#Generate 100 examples of X and y(a simple cubic function of X ). 
X = np.linspace(-3, 3, 100)
y = X ** 3 + np.random.randn(100)

# Plot the data 
plt.figure(figsize=(15,6))
plt.scatter(X, y)
plt.title("Simple quadratic dataset with noise")
plt.xlabel("Feature values")
plt.ylabel("Target values")
```


```python
# Code here
```




    Text(0,0.5,'Target values')

You can try and further complicate the relationship with a more complex function.  Let's now create our features and labels, and also peform a 75/25 split sfor the training and test set. 

```python
# Split the data into a training and test set
X = X[:, np.newaxis]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)

# Print the data dimensions
print(f'Shape X_train: {X_train.shape}')
print(f'Shape y_train: {y_train.shape}')
print(f'Shape X_test: {X_test.shape}')
print(f'Shape y_test: {y_test.shape}')
```


```python
# Code here 
```

    Shape X_train: (75, 1)
    Shape y_train: (75,)
    Shape X_test: (25, 1)
    Shape y_test: (25,)


## Fit a Regression Tree
scikit learn offers a regression tree under the class `DecisionTreeRegressor`. Let's create an instance of this class just like the classification tasks and fit the data. For now , we'll set the max depth parameter to 3, as we now know that increasing this could lead to overfitting. We can experiment with different depths later. 

```python
# Fitting Decision Tree Regression to the dataset
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state = 10, max_depth=3)
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)
```


```python
# Code here 
```




    DecisionTreeRegressor(criterion='mse', max_depth=3, max_features=None,
               max_leaf_nodes=None, min_impurity_decrease=0.0,
               min_impurity_split=None, min_samples_leaf=1,
               min_samples_split=2, min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0,
               presort=False, random_state=10, splitter='best')



## Prediction and Evaluation

So we see above, the default values for most hyperparameters. Kindly check the official doc for details on options available to you for growing regression trees. We can now predict labels with previously unseen data and calculate mse. As an extra measure , we can also look at calculating the R-squared value to inspect the goodness of fit for our model. 
```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error as mse
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

# Make predictions and evaluate 
y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)
print ('MSE score:', mse(y_test, y_pred))
print('R-sq score:',r2_score(y_test,y_pred))
```


```python
# Code here 
```

    MSE score: 5.165993713178738
    R-sq score: 0.9620185253771402


## Visualize the Model Fit
Our R squared score tells us that this appears to be a very good fit (remember r2 ranges from 0(poor) to 1(best)). Let's visualize the learnt function below with our scatter plot from earlier and see how well it fits.

```python
# Visualising the Decision Tree Regression results (higher resolution)
X_grid = np.arange(min(X), max(X), 0.01)
X_grid = X_grid.reshape((len(X_grid), 1))
plt.figure(figsize=(15,6))
plt.scatter(X, y, color = 'red', label='data')
plt.plot(X_grid, regressor.predict(X_grid), color = 'green', label='Regression function')
plt.title('Decision Tree Regression')
plt.xlabel('Features')
plt.ylabel('Target')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```


```python
# Code here 
```

So we have learnt this regression line without using any complex non-linear functions, in a fraction of time. This is the key benefit of regression trees over other regression techniques that we have seen earlier. 

### Some Observations

- We can notice the graph is not continuous.
- Horizontal lines are averages of all data points in sections created.
- These horizontal lines represent sections. Predictions are averages of data points in sections. So prediction for each value lying in one section will be the same.

__Try changing the `max_depth` parameter in the model and grow the tree again. The resulting visualization will clearly show you the impact of tree depth on overfitting.__

## Visualize the Tree
We can also visualize regression trees as before using the `graphviz` library. Let's bring in our code from previous lesson and see how the tree has grown.

```python
#from sklearn.externals.six import StringIO  
from IPython.display import Image  
from sklearn.tree import export_graphviz
import pydotplus
dot_data = StringIO()
export_graphviz(regressor, out_file=dot_data, filled=True, rounded=True,special_characters=True)
graph = pydotplus.graph_from_dot_data(dot_data.getvalue())  
Image(graph.create_png())
```


```python
# Code here
```

## Caveats

Without regularization, decision trees are likely to overfit the training examples. This can be prevented using techniques like *pruning* or by providing a maximum allowed tree depth and/or a minimum number of samples required to split a node further as we saw with regression.

## Summary 

In this lesson, we learnt about CART trees for regression and classification. We looked at how CART algorithm works, along with MSE , as a loss measure used as a learning mechanism. We saw a simple experiment with some synthetic data  where we used a tree regressor to learn a non linear function. We saw that this approach is much simpler and computationally efficient than using non-linear regression functions.
